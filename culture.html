    <p>The musical lineage of Madhya Pradesh is nurtured all over the state in the forms of classical, folk and tribal music. The tribal people of Bastar truly could sing their way through every problem. They fashioned music from leaves, fruit seeds, pots, pans and so on. The instruments used by them are extraordinary itself. <b>Singha</b> might just be the first instrument ever forged by man, <b>Pungi or been </b> is popular with Jogis and snake charmers in India, <b>Marias</b> are richly ornamented brass trumpets and other Percussion, Auto phonic instruments are broadly used.
<br>
        Madhya Pradesh's arsenal is filled with folk songs. Every song has a story to tell, just sit back and close your eyes, every note tells a tale of sacrifice, love, and duty. The folklore of <b>Dhola Maru</b> is commonly sung around the regions of Malwa, Nimar, and Bundelkhand; it's about the Dhola Maru's story of love, separation, and reunion. The melodious music of <b>Chang and Dhaf</b> is readily played in the parts of Mandla, Malwa, Bundelkhand and Nimar, the music is magnetic.
