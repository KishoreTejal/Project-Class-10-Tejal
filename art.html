        <p>The myths and legends in association with the state have been a great source of influence for the artists of Bihar since the old days. Mithila being the birthplace of Sita, episodes of the Ramayana are a common theme.
            <br>
            <b>Madhubani Art</b> form was born in Mithila. The Madhubani art form is a pride of Bihar that has become popular worldwide. Originally the Madhubani paintings were done by women with vegetable dyes for decoration on the walls. Once a visiting artist inspired the ladies to start painting this art form on paper. The Madhubani art form came out of its regional borders and spread across the nation and later the world.
            <br>
            Other art forms like <b>stone pottery, bamboo crafts, white metal statues, leather goods, and wooden toys</b> are also famous in Bihar. These art forms, along with Madhubani, have made Bihar gain a lot of popularity on a global scale.
